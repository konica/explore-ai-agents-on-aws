# --- Strands Agent -------------------------------------------------------

#   - A system prompt (instructions for the LLM)
#   - Tools (functions the LLM can call)
#
# When a message comes in, the agent sends it to the LLM. The LLM reads
# the system prompt, sees the available tools, and decides whether to call
# get_weather. If it does, the tool runs, and the LLM formats the final answer.
